                As a moderator, you'll be interacting with the community on a regular basis, answering questions, keeping chat civil, and acting as an interface between the staff team and the community. You'll also have the pleasure of banning people who join and immediately start spamming, along with nuking spammers/x-rayers.
                <br><br>

                As a staff team, we have weekly meetings where we discuss the events of the last week and what the next steps are going forward. Many critical server decisions are made in these meetings, and as a staff member, you will have a not-so-subtle impact on how the server functions.
                <br><br>

                If you remain in the staff team long enough and demonstrate good technical skills, you may be offered a position as an administrator. As an administrator, you'll be actively maintaining the server, along with being directly involved in developing new content and other complex technical tasks.
