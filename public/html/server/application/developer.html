                Developers play an increasingly important role in the operation of the server. As a developer, you'll be working on custom plugins for MetaMechanists, including our Slimefun addon MetaMachines. In addition, you'll be working on a top-secret large and highly ambitious project that, if successful, will dictate the future of MetaMechanists.
                <br><br>

                You'll be working under supervision of the Head Developer (Justin), but you will have flexibility to implement features as you see fit. Once on the development team, you'll be given access to our test network, where you'll be able to test changes and new plugins with minimal effort.
                <br><br>

                No prior knowledge of Java or Minecraft development is required.
