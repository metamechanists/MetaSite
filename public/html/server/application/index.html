                Being a staff member is a great opportunity for you to develop yourself as a person. Our staff members have vastly different beliefs and experiences, and you'll be exposed to new ideas, new people, and new perspectives. Through this you can improve your communication and teamwork skills, as well as gaining practical skills such as learning more about the infrastructure behind all the different services we run.
                <br><br>

                We operate with a flexible, largely horizontal leadership structure where every staff member is given freedom to play their strengths. There are always several exciting and varied projects available to work on, and your actions will have a recognisable effect on a community.
                <br><br>

                If you have any questions about staff positions, feel free to message any staff member on <a href = "https://discord.com/invite/6Ew8BYxUtZ" class = "text-link">Discord</a>.

                <h class="text-heading-small">Application Review</h>
                <br>
                We'll discuss your application and decide whether we want to invite you for an interview. This usually takes <b>between 1 and 7 days</b> from when you submit your application.
                <br>
                <br>

                <h class="text-heading-small">Interview</h>
                <br>
                If we decide to go forward with your application, we'll invite you in for an interview in a voicechat. The interview usually lasts <b>between 30 minutes and 1 hour</b> for all positions. We're mostly looking to see if you'd mesh well with the rest of the staff team. We'll typically also ask some more complex questions or ask you to complete a task depending on which position you applied for.

                <h class="text-heading-small">Probation</h>
                <br>
                After passing your interview, you'll be invited to join the staff team in whichever position you applied for. You'll then be on probation for <b>4 weeks</b>. At the end of these four weeks, the rest of the team will evaluate your performance and vote on whether to keep you permanently.
