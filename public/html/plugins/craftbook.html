            <wiki-info>
                A list of all the Craftbook mechanics and explanations of how they work can be found <a class="text-link" href="https://craftbook.enginehub.org/en/3.x/mechanics/">here</a>, but keep in mind that many of them are disabled due to conflicts with Slimefun, redundant additions, and other issues.

            <p>
                Craftbook is a plugin that adds a large number of extra mechanics, from ladders acting as vertical rails, to toggleable gates and bridges. You can unlock new mechanics from crates - note that crates for different ranks contain different mechanics that can be unlocked.

                Unlocked by default

            <h2>Jack-O-Lantern Switch</h2>
            <p>
                Carved pumpkins will turn into jack-o-lanterns when a redstone signal is applied, and back into carved pumpkins once the signal is removed.
            </p>

            <h2>Redstone Jukeboxes</h2>
            <p>
                Jukeboxes will start playing when a redstone signal is applied, and stop playing when the signal is removed.
            </p>

            <h2>More Rails</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Pressure Plates now acts as a 4-way intersection for minecarts</li>
                <li>Ladders and Vines now act as vertical rails</li>
                <li>Gold Ore underneath a rail gives the minecart a 25% speed boost</li>
                <li>A Gold Block underneath a rail accelerates the minecart to maximum speed</li>
                <li>Gravel underneath a rail slows the minecart by 20%</li>
                <li>Soul Sand underneath a rail slows the minecart by 50%</li>
            </ul>

                Locked
            </h1>

            <wiki-info>
                Locked mechanics can be obtained with the Craftbook crate at /warp crates
            </wiki-info>

            <h2>Ammeters</h2>
            <p>
                Right clicking any redstone device with coal will tell you the redstone level of that device.
            </p>

            <h2>Light Stones</h2>
            <p>
                Right clicking any block with glowstone dust will tell you the light level of that block.
            </p>

            <h2>Bridges</h2>
            <p>
                A bridge is a horizontal area that can be toggled. The bridge itself will need to be made out of one material. You'll need to place a sign on one end of the bridge (above, below, or on the side of the central block). The second line of the sign must be [Bridge]. Place an identical signpost on the other end of the bridge to complete it. Now, you can toggle the bridge by right-clicking one of the signs.
            </p>
            <img src="/image/wiki/bridge.png">

            <h2>Doors</h2>
            <p>
                Doors are similar to bridges, but vertical instead. The key difference between bridges and doors is that the sign placement must be directly above and below the door, as shown below. The sign at the bottom of the door must be [Door Up], and the sign at the top must be [Door Down].
            </p>
            <img src="/image/wiki/door.png">

            <h2>Sign Copying</h2>
            <p>
                Right click a sign with a piece of leather to copy text, and then left click another sign with a piece of leather to paste the text.
            </p>

            <h2>Minecart Elevator</h2>
            <p>
                Nether Bricks with rails running over them and a sign below with [CartLift Up] or [CartLift Down] allows you to lift carts up and down
            </p>
            <img src="/image/wiki/cartlift.png">

            <h2>Minecart Ejector</h2>
            <p>
                Rails with Iron Blocks under them will eject players in any cart passing over
            </p>

            <h2>Minecart Sorter</h2>
            <p>
                Minecarts can be sorted using a Sorter. This is a bit more complicated, so refer to <a class="text-link" href="https://craftbook.enginehub.org/en/3.x/mechanics/minecart/block/sorter/">here</a> if you want to learn more
            </p>

            <h2>Better Pistons</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Attaching a sign with [Crush] on the second line to a piston will cause the piston to destroy the block in front of it
                </li>
                <li>
                    Attaching a sign with [Bounce] on the second line and a number from 1 to 10 on the second line (specifying bounce velocity) to a piston causes the piston to propel entities directly in front of it
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add a sign with [SuperSticky] on the second line and (distance)-(blocks per pulse) on the third line to a sticky piston to increase its range. For example, putting 10-2 on the third line means the piston will pull from up to 10 blocks away, and will pull blocks twice when a redstone signal is applied. Adding AIR to the last line will cause the piston to treat air as a solid block.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add a sign with [SuperPush] on the second line and (distance)-(blocks per pulse) on the third line to a piston to increase its range. This is very similar to the SuperSticky piston.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Bounce Blocks</h2>
            <p>
                Blocks that have a sign with [Jump] on the second line and a vector for velocity on the third line will assign players that velocity when they jump on the block. The velocity is in the format 'x,y,z' (without quotes).
            </p>

            <h2>Experience Storage</h2>
            <p>
                Right clicking a spawner will remove a certain amount of XP and use it to create an XP bottle. A spawner can also have a sign attached with [XP] on the second line and the range in the third line - this will cause the spawner to acquire and store experience orbs in a certain radius.
            </p>

            <h2>Integrated Circuits</h2>
            <p>
                Integrated Circuits can perform complex operations in one block. A full explanation and list of Integrated Circuits can be found <a class="text-link" href="https://craftbook.enginehub.org/en/3.x/mechanics/ics/">here</a>.
