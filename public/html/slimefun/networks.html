            <h1>Overview</h1>

            <wiki-warning>
                Cargo is an alternative to using Networks. However, Cargo has extremely adverse effects on server performance, so we recommend using Networks unless absolutely necessary.
            </wiki-warning>

            <p>
                Networks is an addon that allows you to connect your Slimefun machines together. This is where you can really start getting into automation! Make sure you're familiar with energy networks before attempting anything with Networks. In fact, Networks isn't very useful without any machines to interact with, so we recommend having at least a basic electricity network set up with a few machines.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you've ever played with Refined Storage or Applied Energistics, this is very similar.

            <h1>Network Components</h1>

            <wiki-info>
                Networks does not act like an electric network - all the blocks must be directly connected to each other.
            </wiki-info>

            <wiki-info>
                A Network requires storage to function. The easiest way to do this is with Cells, but Quantum Storages tend to be better long-term.
            </wiki-info>

            <wiki-info>
                Pushers & grabbers cannot interact with vanilla inventories, but there are variants that can (vanilla pushers & grabbers).
            </wiki-info>

            <p>
                Here are some of the most common Network components:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Controller</b> - Like the Energy Regulator, the centre of any Network.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Bridge</b> - Like Energy Connectors, extends the reach of the Network.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Grabber</b> - Allows the Network to take items from the machine it's attached to.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Pusher</b> - Allows the Network to push items into the machine it's attached to.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Monitor</b> - Can be used to interact with Infinity Expansion storage units, you can interact with them using Monitors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Quantum</b> Storage - Adds item storage capacity to the Network itself.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Grid</b> - Allows you to view the items stored in the Network.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </wiki-box>

            <h1>Example</h1>

            <p>
                Here's an example of a basic Network setup.
            </p>

            <img src="/image/wiki/basic-network.png">

            <p>
                Let's break it down:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The machine on the left is an Electric Ore Grinder, the machine on the right is an Electric Gold Pan.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The black stained glass is a Controller.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The white stained glass blocks are Bridges.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The honeycomb block is a Cell, giving the Network storage space.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The purple stained stained glass is a Grabber grabbing gravel from the Electric Ore Grinder.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Brown Stained Glass is a Pusher pushing gravel into the Electric Gold Pan.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The pusher does have to be configured so that it knows which item to push to the Electric Gold Pan. Note that only one slot in the Network Pusher's filter slots needs to be set for the pusher to fill up the input inventory of the connected block.
            </p>

            <h1>Autocrafting</h1>

            <wiki-warning>
                Encoders consume 20kJ of energy from the Network every time you encode a blueprint. You'll need to use a Network Capacitor to import energy into the Network. Autocrafters also consume energy from the network.
            </wiki-warning>

            <wiki-info>
                The Withholding Autocrafter retains its output items after completing a craft and doesn't send them to storage.
            </wiki-info>

            <p>
                To begin autocrafting, you'll need an Encoder. Place the recipe you wish to craft in your encoder, and encode then it:
            </p>

            <img src="/image/wiki/encoder.png">

            <p>
                Now place the Autocrafter and add the Blueprint to it. The Autocrafter will automatically pull items from the Network, and does not need a Pusher attached. However, they will need a grabber if you wish to send the crafted item into storage via network monitors.
            </p>
