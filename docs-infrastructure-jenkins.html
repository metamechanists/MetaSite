            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Jenkins is a continuous integration tool, but it can be used for automating many tasks such as backups. This makes it a point of vulnerability as it is the only web-facing interface that does tasks such as executing shell scripts. It's therefore imperative that Jenkins only has access to the files it absolutely needs access to.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>
                Development tasks are linked to Github repositories. A typical build task does this:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A developer pushes a commit to the linked Github repository
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Github calls a Jenkins-provided webhook, causing Jenkins to start the build task
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Jenkins pulls the latest version of the Github repository
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Jenkins changes directory to the local location of the repository and invokes Maven or Gradle
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The output file is renamed to omit any version information
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The output file is then copied into an archive and labelled with its build number
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The output file is moved into the relevant test server plugins folder, overwriting any file with the same name
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Jenkins creates a restart.txt file in the relevant test server data-storage folder
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        A Discord webhook is called which sends a notification to the build channel indicating the build status
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        MetaUtils detects the restart.txt file and restarts the server
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Deployment</h2>
            <p>
                Deployment is simply copying the latest file of a plugin from the relevant test server plugins folder, and pasting it in the relevant main server plugins folder.
            </p>

            <h2>NAS Backups</h2>
            <p>
                NAS backups are very simple. The NAS backup task runs every Sunday, and three backups will exist at once (ie: three weeks worth of backups).
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Jenkins checks that the NAS is mounted, and exits and fails the build if it is not
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The backup from two weeks ago is deleted
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The backup from two weeks ago is renamed to indicate it is the backup from three weeks ago
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The backup from last week is renamed to indicate it is the backup from two weeks ago
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        A new directory is created to store this week's backup
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A shell script is invoked that compresses the entire filesystem (omitting some directories) and outputs it in the created directory. This must be run as root so it can access all the files. Only this shell file can be run as root so this is not a security vulnerability as long as the shell file cannot be edited (which it can't).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Server Backups</h2>
            <p>
                Server backups are relatively simple. The backup task runs every day, and three layers of backups are kept: one is updated monthly, one weekly, and one daily. Additionally, backups from both today and yesterday are kept. The script itself is well documented, so refer to <a target=_blank href=https://build.metamechanists.org/job/MetaMechanists/job/Administration/job/MetaBackup%E2%84%A2%EF%B8%8F/configure class=text-link>here</a> for documentation on the script.
            </p>

            <h2>Server Updates</h2>
            <p>
                Automated updates use a combination of the Spiget API and custom wget/curl requests to update plugins for a given server. Refer to the update scripts themselves to see which plugins they update and do not update or add new plugins - they are fairly self-documenting.
            </p>
