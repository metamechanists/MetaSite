                Our builders construct spawns and minigames. Although we have finished our third and likely final spawn, there is plenty of work to be done improving the spawns and building new minigames for events. There are currently several interesting projects on the  TODO list, but there is comparatively little pressure to get them done, and so we are willing to be very flexible in terms of time. Aria_Night (aka QueenOfCurry) heads the build team and organises projects, but you will still have plenty of flexibility to work on what you want. The rest of the staff team also occasionally helps with builds.
